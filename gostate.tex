\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We present several results concerning
the number of positions and games of Go.
We derive recurrences for $L(m,n)$,
the number of legal positions on an $m \times n$ board,
and develop a dynamic programming algorithm which computes
$L(m,n)$ in time $O(m^3 n^2 \lambda^m)$ and space $O(m \lambda^m)$,
for some constant $\lambda < 5.4$.
An implementation of this algorithm lets us list $L(n,n)$ for $n\leq 18$.
For bigger boards, we prove existence of a
{\em base of liberties} $\lim_{m,n \rightarrow \infty} \sqrt[mn]{L(m,n)}$ of
$2.9757341920433572493\ldots$.
Based on a conjecture about vanishing error-terms,
we derive an asymptotic formula for $L(m,n)$,
which is shown to be highly accurate.

We also study the Game Tree complexity of Go,
proving an upper bound on the number of possible games
of $(mn)^{L(m,n)}$ and a lower bound
of $2^{2^{n^2/2\,-O(n)}}$ on $n\times n$ and $2^{2^{n-1}}$
on $1 \times n$ boards, in addition to
exact counts for $mn \leq 4$ and estimates up to $mn=9$.
We end with investigating whether one game can encompass all legal positions.
%, and a study of the maximum number of strings.

\section{Introduction}
Originating over 3000 years ago in China,
Go~\cite{gowiki} is perhaps the oldest boardgame in the world,
enjoyed by millions of players worldwide.
Its deceptively simple rules~\cite{gorules}
give rise to amazing strategic depth.
Results about the computational complexity of Go
date back some 25 years. In 1980, Lichtenstein and Sipser~\cite{LS80}
proved Go PSPACE-hard, while 3 years later, Robson~\cite{R83}
showed Go with the basic ko rule to be EXPTIME-complete. More recently,
certain subproblems of the game have been shown PSPACE-complete,
like endgames~\cite{W02} and ladders~\cite{CT00}.
This paper focuses instead on the {\em state complexity} of Go.
We are motivated by the fact that
the number of legal positions is a fundamental property of a game,
the notion of legal position being unambigiously defined for Go
despite many variations in rulesets, and that its computation turns
out to be almost, but not quite, impossible. In particular, we
demonstrate how computing the number of legal 19x19 positions,
a number of 171 digits, will be feasible by 2015.

\section{Previous work}
Results about the state complexity of Go have been mostly confined
to the online newsgroup {\tt rec.games.go} and the {\tt computer-go}
mailing list.
In September 1992, a {\tt rec.games.go} thread ``complexity of go''
raised the question of how many positions are legal.
It was noted that a trivial upper bound is $3^{mn}$,
since every point on the board may be empty, black,
or white. A position is legal if and only if every string of
connected stones of the same color has an empty point adjacent to it.
Achim Flammenkamp was the first to post simulation results, showing
that $L(19,19) \sim 0.012 \times 3^{361} \sim 2.089 \times 10^{170}$.
In August 1994, a thread ``Complexity of Chess and Go'' revisited the problem.
Jack Hahn, Jonathan Cano, and John Tromp all posted programs to compute the
number of legal positions by brute force enumeration.
The largest count published at the time was $L(4,5)=1840058693$.
A week's worth of computation would have found $L(5,5)$ as well,
but enumerating $L(6,6)$ takes over 10000 times longer, severely
limiting this approach.

In a January 2000 thread
``Number of Legal Positions on Almost Rectangular Boards'',
inspired by earlier remarks by John Tromp and Hans Zschintzsch,
Les Fables first explained in detail how to count using dynamic programming.
His remark ``{\it Calculation for 9x9 should be possible on any PC,
and a supercomputer should easily be able to handle 13x13.}''
proves to be spot on.
Much later, on January 23, 2005, Eric Boesch independently discovered
this method on the {\tt computer-go} mailing list. His method is
implemented the next day by Tapani Raiko, but a bug leads him to post a wrong
count for $L(5,5)$. Later that day Jeffrey Rainy,
based on his own implementation, gives the correct values for
$L(5,5)$ and $L(6,6)$ but wrong values for $L(7,7)$ and $L(8,8)$.
Finally, the next day, Gunnar Farneb\"{a}ck posts the first bugfree program,
providing counts up to $L(10,10)$.

In June 1999, a thread ``Math and Go''
discussed the number of games
of Go. Robert Jasiek claimed an upper bound of $n^{3^n}$, which still
needs to be corrected for intermediate passes. John Tromp showed
how to get a double exponential lower bound, which we make more formal
while fixing a slight flaw, in this paper.
In the same month, John Tromp started a thread ``number of 2*2 games'',
noting that the number is 386356909593, as was recently independently
verified.

%In November 2006, a thread "Maximum number of strings" on the
%{\tt computer-go} mailing list reported on research by
%Youhei Yano and Ryuhei Miyashiro who used Linear Programming
%to compute the maximum possible number of strings, which was found to
%be 277 for $19 \times 19$.

\section{Preliminaries}
A position on an $m\times n$ Go board is a
mapping from the set of {\em points}
$\{0,\ldots,m-1\}\times \{0,\ldots,n-1\}$ to the set of colors
$\{\mbox{empty}, \mbox{black}, \mbox{white}\}$.
Points are {\em adjacent} in the usual grid sense---equal
in one coordinate and differing by one in the other.
A point colored black or white is called a {\em stone}.
Adjacent stones of the same color form connected components
called {\em strings}. An empty point adjacent to a string is called a
{\em liberty} of that string.
A game of Go starts with an empty board. The players, black and white,
alternate turns, starting with black.
On his turn, a player can either {\em pass}, or make a move which doesn't
repeat an earlier position.
This is the so-called Positional SuperKo (PSK) rule. Some rulesets,
notably the American Go Association's AGA rules, use the Situational
SuperKo (SSK) rule, which only forbids repeating a position with
the same player to move.
A move consists of coloring an empty point your color, followed by
emptying all opponent strings without liberties (capture), followed by
emptying all your own strings which then have no liberties (suicide).
Finally, two consecutive passes end the game.
Thus, in positions arising in a Go game,
strings always have liberties. Such positions are called {\em legal}.
The number of legal $m \times n$ positions is denoted $L(m,n)$.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\epsfxsize=9cm \epsfbox{ALL2.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{All $3^4$ $2 \times 2$ positions, with illegal ones crossed.}
\label{ALL2}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{ALL2} shows all positions on a $2 \times 2$ board.
Obviously, the 16 bottom-right positions with 4 stones are illegal.
Additionally, the other $8$ crossed positions,
with a stone of one color neighboured by two stones of
the opposite color, are illegal. Since all positions with 2 or fewer stones
are legal, we find that $L(2,2) = 3^4-16-8=57$.

\begin{defin}[game graph]
Let $G(m,n)$ be the directed graph whose vertices are the legal $m\times n$
positions, and which has a directed edge $p \rightarrow q$ whenever
a white or black move from position $p$ results in position $q \neq p$.
\end{defin}

Note that we exclude self-loops, corresponding to single-stone suicides,
which are prohibited by the PSK rule.
This will prove useful in Lemma~\ref{movesedges} below.

\epsfxsize=12cm \epsfbox{G22.eps}
\caption{game graph $G(2,2)$ with nodes/edges grouped
into rotation/mirror symmetry classes.}
\label{G2}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{G21} shows $G(1,2)$, consisting of 5 nodes and 12 edges,
Figure~\ref{G31} shows $G(1,3)$, consisting of 15 nodes and 42 edges,
while Figure~\ref{G2} shows $G(2,2)$ factored into rotation/mirror
symmetry classes. Piet Hut observed that
these latter two graphs are the only ones with no 2-loops.
We next establish some basic properties of Go game graphs.

\begin{lemma}
Outgoing edges from a position are in 1-1 correspondence with moves
that are not single-stone suicides.
\label{movesedges}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Given a position $p$, each move uniquely determines
a resulting position $q$ and hence an edge $p \rightarrow q$.
It remains to show the converse;
that a resulting position $q \neq p$ uniquely determines a move.
If $q$ has one more stone of color $c$, say at position $(x,y)$,
and the same or fewer stones of opposite color, then that was the move.
If $q$ has fewer stones of color $c$ and the same number of stones
of opposite color, then the missing stones must form a string with
1 liberty, and the move was a suicide.
It can be seen that these cases are exhaustive, the former covering
all non-suicide moves, and the latter covering all multiple-stone suicides.
\end{proof}

\begin{coro}
\label{outdeg}
A node with $k$ empty points has outdegree at most $2k$.
\end{coro}

\begin{coro}
Each edge has an implied black or white color.
\end{coro}

Recall that a {\em simple} path is one that has no
repeated vertices.

\begin{lemma}
\label{gamepaths}
Go games are in 1-1 correspondence with simple paths
starting at the empty position in the game graph.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The previous Lemma shows that any path corresponds to a sequence
of moves, not necessarily alternating in color.
Inserting a single pass before every out-of-turn move,
and 2 passes at the end, produces a properly alternating and ending game.
The starting node ensures that the game starts from an empty board,
while simplicity of the path ensures that each move is legal.
Furthermore, since any game can be stripped of its
passes to produce the corresponding path, this is a bijection.
\end{proof}

The above Lemma applies only to rules with Positional SuperKo.
With Situational SuperKo, the corresponding paths are not necessarily
simple, and a position can be visited twice (once by each player).
%if the first visit is not followed by a pass.

\begin{lemma}
The game graph is strongly connected.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Obviously we can reach any position from the empty board, so it
suffices to show that we can reach the empty position from any position.
We eliminate strings one by one, without ever creating new strings.
To eliminate a string, its owner repeatedly plays on its liberties
while his opponent passes.
Some opponent strings may get captured in the process, but ultimately,
the string itself will commit suicide.
\end{proof}

Note that this result depends on the possibility of suicide,
and fails to hold for alternative rulesets, such as the Japanese
rules of Go, which forbid suicide. Under such rules, a slightly weaker
property can be shown.

\begin{lemma}
On all boards except $1 \times 1$, $1 \times 2$ and $2 \times 1$,
the game subgraph obtained by removing the empty position and all
suicide edges is strongly connected.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First note that $G(1,1)$ has no suicide-edges to remove,
while $G(1,2)$ breaks into 2 components when removing the empty position.
Obviously, we can reach any position from a suitable single-stone position,
so it suffices to show that we can reach every single-stone position
from any position.
First, one player, say black, repeatedly plays on a liberty of its strings.
When all such plays result in suicides, the other player, white, can proceed
to capture all black strings.
Next, white can play until she has $mn-1$ stones, which black then captures.
Given that $mn \geq 3$, we can repeat this last phase to lead to a
capture by the desired color on the desired point.
\end{proof}

\section{Counting legal positions}

The simplest way to count $L(m,n)$, the number of legal $m \times n$
positions, is by brute force, just trying
all $3^{mn}$ positions and testing each one for legality.
However, a $5 \times 5$ board already has over 400 billion possible
positions, and $9 \times 9$ has over $10^{38}$.
Instead, we establish a correspondence between legal positions and
paths in the so called {\em border state graph}, whose size is much
more manageable. The problem thus reduces to that of counting paths
of a certain length in a graph, which can be done efficiently
by the method of Dynamic Programming.
First we introduce the notion of partial boards, from which the
border states naturally arise.

\subsection{Partial Boards}

Recall from the preliminaries that we number the points
$(x,y) \in \{0,\ldots,n-1\}\times \{0,\ldots,m-1\}$.
We picture a go board with the point $(0,0)$ in the top-left,
$x$-coordinates increasing to the right, and $y$-coordinates
increasing downward.
For $0 \leq x < n$ and $0 \leq y < m$,
let a partial go board up to column $x$ and row $y$ consist
of all the points to the left of and above $(x,y)$.
It has $x$ full columns and, if $y > 0$, one partial column of $y$ points.
Figure~\ref{border} shows two example partial $7\times n$ positions
up to $(3,3)$.

\begin{figure}
\epsfxsize=10cm \epsfbox{partial.eps}
\caption{Two partial positions up to $(3,3)$ and their common border state.}
\label{border}
\end{figure}

What these positions have in common is that
the set of possible completions into legal full-board positions
is identical. In either case, the remainder of the position has
to provide a liberty to the top white group, to the
black group it surrounds, and to the middle black group.
We say that the positions share the same {\em border state}.

\subsection{Border States}

\begin{defin}[border state]
A {\em border state}, or {\em state} for short, comprises the following
data:
\begin{itemize}
\item the board height $m$,
\item the size $0 \leq y <m $ of the partial column,
\item the color of border points
      $(x,0),\ldots,(x,y-1),(x-1,y),\ldots,(x-1,m-1)$
      ($x$ is only a symbol whose value is immaterial to the state),
\item for each stone on the border, whether it has liberties,
\item connections among libertyless stones.
\end{itemize}

% empty points on the border imply liberties for adjacent stones.
%\item adjacent same-colored stones are connected.
%\item connections form an equivalence relation.

A state with height $m$ and partial column size $y$ is called an
$\binom{m}{y}$-state,
or simply $y$-state if $m$ is clear from context.
A partial position is pseudolegal if
all libertyless stones are on, or connected to, the border.
A state is called {\em constructible} if it is the border state of some
pseudolegal partial position of arbitrary width.
\end{defin}

Information of liberties and connections is assumed to
be consistent within the border.

A partial position up to $(0,y)$ has a border state where
points $(x-1,y),\ldots,(x-1,m-1)$ are off the board.
We accomodate these zero-width positions
by allowing the non-color `edge' for all $(x-1,\cdot)$ points,
and call the result an {\em edge state} instead.

In figures, libertyless stones and their connections are indicated with
lines emanating to the left.

The set of constructible states is difficult to characterize,
and hence to count. We therefore introduce a slightly larger class.

\begin{defin}
Call a $y$-state $s$ {\em valid} if it satisfies all the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item connections don't cross, i.e. if 4 stones are ordered vertically as
      $a,b,c,d$, with $a$ and $c$ connected, and $b$ and $d$ connected,
      then they must all be connected.
\item if a stone at $(x,y-1)$ either
\begin{itemize}
\item has connections, but (if $y>1$) not to $(x,y-2)$, or
\item has liberties, but (if $y>1$) $(x,y-2)$ is opposite-colored,
\end{itemize}
      then points $(x,y-1)$ and $(x-1,y)$ are considered adjacent.
\end{itemize}
\end{defin}

\begin{lemma}
\label{constructibleisvalid}
Every constructible state is valid.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The non-crossing property can be seen to follow from the planarity
of two-dimensional boards.
If border point $(x,y-1)$ has a connection
necessarily going through non-border point $(x-1,y-1)$,
then the latter's neighbour $(x-1,y)$ is effectively
also the former's neighbour. This virtual adjacency
implies that $(x-1,y)$ must be either opposite colored,
or same colored and connected to $(x,y-1)$.
Similarly, if $(x,y-1)$ has a liberty necessarily obtained through
$(x-1,y-1)$, then $(x,y-1)$ is effectively adjacent to $(x-1,y)$,
preventing the latter from being a same colored-stone without liberties.
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
{\epsfxsize=2cm \epsfbox{unrealizable.eps}} \hspace{4cm}
{\epsfxsize=2cm \epsfbox{shape.eps}}
\end{center}
\caption{(a) a valid but unconstructible state (b) non-rectangular boardshape}
\label{validshape}
\end{figure}

The smallest example of a valid but not constructible state occurs at $m=3$
as shown in Figure~\ref{validshape}(a).
%is the single non-constructible valid $\binom{3}{2}$-class.
Any partial board that connects the two white stones
and provides a liberty to the black stone,
will inevitably provide a liberty to the white stones as well.
In other words,
the fixed board height of $3$ doesn't allow the white string to distance
itself from the black one.
If we allowed variable height board shapes
such as the one shown in Figure~\ref{validshape}(b),
then the above valid state would become constructible.
It can be shown that
non-constructability of valid states is due entirely to the `lack
of room' to simultaneously provide liberties and connections.

We can somewhat efficiently compute the number of valid $0$-border states,
each of which corresponds to a balanced path of length $m$
through the finite automaton shown later in Figure~\ref{borderdfa}.
In a {\em balanced} path the
up and down connections of libertyless black and white stones
match up properly like balanced parentheses of two types, e.g. `([]([]))'.
Using Dynamic Programming,
we can compute the number of such paths
ending in a given vertex of the automaton with a given
stack of pending connections. With at most $m/2$ pending
connections, there are at most $2^{m/2}$ such stacks.
Having all counts for paths of length $l$, we can in time
$O(2^{m/2})$ compute all counts for paths of length $l+1$,
thus taking time $O(m2^{m/2})$ overall.
It took only 0.005 sec to determine the number of $\binom{19}{0}$ border states
in this manner.
Computing numbers of $y$-states for $y>0$,
numbers of edge states, and of state classes is only slightly more complicated
and can be done within the same time complexity.

Table~\ref{borderstates} shows for each $m$ the minimum and maximum
number of valid $\binom{m}{y}$-border state classes,
which turn out to be achieved at $y=0$ and $y=m-1$, respectively.
The maximum is always about 45\% larger than the minimum.

\label{borderstates}
\end{table}

Only a tiny percentage of the listed valid states fails to be constructible
(e.g. only 337 of the 109736 valid $\binom{9}{0}$-classes).

\subsection{The border state graph}

\begin{figure}
\epsfxsize=12cm \epsfbox{expandborder.eps}
\caption{A border state and its 3 successors.}
\label{successors}
\end{figure}

Let's see how
the border state of a partial board up to $(x,y)$ and the color of $(x,y)$
uniquely determine the border state up to $(x,y+1)$,
as exemplified in Figure~\ref{successors}.
If $(x,y)$ is empty, then any libertyless stones at $(x,y-1)$ and $(x-1,y)$
as well as all stones connected to them, become stones with liberties.
Otherwise, suppose $(x,y)$ is black.

If $(x-1,y)$ is a libertyless white stone without connections, then
the new partial board is no longer pseudolegal; a case we must avoid.

If either $(x,y-1)$ or $(x-1,y)$ is empty or
black with liberties then $(x,y)$ has liberties,
which it may provide to the other neighbour
(if that is black without liberties).

Finally, if neither $(x,y-1)$ nor $(x-1,y)$ provides liberties,
then $(x,y)$ is without liberties and connects any black neighbours.

The case for $(x,y)$ being white is identical with all colors reversed.

Similarly, the edge state of a partial board up to $(0,y)$
and the color of $(0,y)$ uniquely determine
the edge state up to $(0,y+1)$ (in case $y<m-1$)
or border state up to $(1,0)$ (in case $y=m-1$).

\begin{defin}[(augmented) border state graph]
Let $B(m)$ be the directed graph whose vertices are the constructible
border states of height $m$,
and which has edges from each $y$-state to its 2 or 3 successor
$((y+1)\bmod m)$ states.
The augmented border state graph $AB(m)$ has additional vertices and
outgoing edges for all edge states.
\end{defin}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\epsfxsize=5cm \epsfbox{B1.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Augmented border state graph $AB(1)$.}
\label{onebordergraph}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\epsfxsize=12cm \epsfbox{B2.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Edges between state classes of $B(2)$.}
\label{twobordergraph}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{successors} shows the 3 successors of a border state,
while Figure~\ref{onebordergraph} shows
the augmented border state graph $AB(1)$.
Border state graph $B(2)$ is too large to show in full detail,
so instead of border states we show border state {\em classes}.

%Each edge from a class with stones
%thus represents 2 edges in $B(2)$, one from each of the 2 states in the class
%(necessarily leading to equivalent states).
For further clarity, Figure~\ref{twobordergraph} 
shows edges between the 9 $0$-state classes and 13 $1$-state classes
separately for each direction,
with the state classes ordered to minimize edge crossings.
Thick edges represent the case where adding a black stone
and adding a white stone lead to equivalent states in $B(2)$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{connected-border-graph}
  The border state graph is strongly connected.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Every $y$-state reaches the stoneless $y$-state after $m$ empty
successors, and thus reaches the stoneless $0$-state after another
$m-y$ empty successors.
From the latter, we can reach any possible column~0 state $s$,
and hence any constructible state, as follows. Note that $s$ can be reached
in $m$ steps from a $0$-state $s'$ that replaces each stone in $s$ by
a stone with liberties of the opposite color, effectively forming
a virtual edge. Any such state $s'$ can clearly by reached from
the stoneless $0$-state in $m$ steps.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{positionpaths}
There is a 1-1 correspondence between pseudolegal partial positions up
to $(n,y)$ and paths of length $mn+y$ through the augmented border state
graph that start at the all-edge state.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction on $mn+y$. The unique partial position up to $(0,0)$
corresponds to the length $0$ path starting at the all-edge state.
Furthermore, for a path ending at state $s$ corresponding to a
pseudolegal partial position $p$ up to $(n,y)$, the successors of $s$
correspond exactly to the pseudolegal partial positions $p'$ up to
$(n,y+1)$ (or $(n+1,0)$ for $y=m-1$) that extend $p$ by one point.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Recurrences}

\begin{defin}[state counts]
For an $\binom{m}{y}$-state $s$,
denote by $L(m,n,y,s)$ the number of pseudolegal
partial positions up to $(n,y)$ that have border/edge state $s$
(or equivalently, the number of paths of length $mn+y$ in the augmented
border state graph from the all-edge state to $s$).
Call a $y$-state $s$ {\em legal} if $y=0$ and $s$ has no libertyless stones.
\end{defin}

Obviously, we have

\begin{lemma}[color symmetry]
\label{color-symmetry}
Let state $s'$ be derived from state $s$ by reversing the colors
of all stones. Then $L(m,n,y,s) = L(m,n,y,s')$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{defin}[state classes]
We define a {\em state class}, denoted $[s]$, as the equivalence class
of state $s$ under color reversal.
Call a state class {\em legal} when its members are,
and define $L(m,n,y,[s]) = \sum_{s' \in [s]} L(m,n,y,s')$.
\end{defin}

Note that all equivalence classes, except for stoneless states,
consist of exactly 2 states.
These definitions immediately imply

\begin{lemma}
$L(m,n) = \sum_{\mbox{legal }s} L(m,n,0,s)
        = \sum_{\mbox{legal }[s]} L(m,n,0,[s])$.
\label{legal-states}
\end{lemma}

Another form of symmetry occurs in $0$-states only:

\begin{lemma}[up-down symmetry]
\label{up-down-symmetry}
Let state $s'$ be derived from $0$-state $s$ by
reversing the order of points from top to bottom.
Then $L(m,n,y,s) = L(m,n,y,s')$ and $L(m,n,y,[s]) = L(m,n,y,[s'])$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{defin}[state count vector]
Denote by $\BFL(m,n,y)$ the state-indexed vector with elements
$L(m,n,y,s)$ for all constructible $y$-states $s$ (edge states for $n=0$,
border states for $n>0$) and by $\BFl_m$ the
characteristic vector of legal states of height $m$.
\end{defin}

Now Lemma~\ref{legal-states} can be expressed as
\[L(m,n) = \BFl_m^T \BFL(m,n,0).\]
The following crucial observation forms the basis for the recurrences
we derive.
Since $L(m,n,y+1,s)$ equals the sum of
$L(m,n,y,s')$ over all predecessor states $s'$ of $s$ in the augmented border
state graph, it follows that
the border state vectors $\BFL(m,n,y), n>0$ are related by linear
transformations $\BFT_{m,y}$, such that
$\BFL(m,n,y+1) = \BFT_{m,y} \BFL(m,n,y)$
(and $\BFL(m,n+1,0) = \BFT_{m,m-1} \BFL(m,n,m-1)$).
Indeed, the $\BFT_{m,y}$
appear as submatrices of the transposed adjacency matrix of
the border state graph.
As a consequence, successive $0$-state vectors are related as

\[ \BFL(m,n+1,0) = \BFT_{m,m-1} \BFT_{m,m-2} \dots
  \BFT_{m,1} \BFT_{m,0} \BFL(m,n,0). \]

Thus we are led to define

\begin{defin}[Recurrence matrix]
Let $\BFT_m = \BFT_{m,m-1} \dots \BFT_{m,0}$.
%$\BFv_m(n)=\BFL(m,n,0)$, and $\BFv_m(0)=\BFT_m^{-1} \BFv_m(1)$.
\end{defin}

This leads to a matrix power expression for $L(m,n)$:
\[ L(m,n) = \BFl_m^T \BFT_m^{n-1} \BFL(m,1,0). \]

Furthermore, $L(m,n)$ can be shown to satisfy a recurrence not
involving the border state counts. To simplify the following
derivations, $m$ is understood to be fixed and is dropped from the
notation, so that $L(m,n) = \BFl^T \BFT^{n-1} \BFL(1,0)$.

\begin{theorem}
\label{recurrence}
  For fixed $m$, $L(m,n)$ satisfies a linear recurrence
  whose order is at most the number of valid $0$-states.
\end{theorem} 

\begin{proof}
  Let $p(\lambda)$ be the characteristic polynomial of the $r \times r$
  matrix $\BFT$,
  \[
    p(\lambda) = \det (\lambda \mathbf{I} - \BFT) =
    \lambda^r + a_{r-1} \lambda^{r-1} + \dots + a_1 \lambda + a_0.
  \]
  By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, $p(\BFT) = \mathbf{0}$. It
  follows that
  \[
    \BFT^r = -(a_{r-1}\BFT^{r-1} + \dots + a_1
    \BFT + a_0 \mathbf{I})
  \]
  and by multiplication by $\BFT^{k-1}$ that
  \[
    \BFT^{r+k-1} = -(a_{r-1}\BFT^{r+k-2} + \dots +
    a_1 \BFT^{k} + a_0 \BFT^{k-1})
  \]
  for all $k \geq 1$. Multiplying by
  $\BFl^T$ on the left and $\BFL(1)$ on the right yields
  \[
    \begin{split}
      L(m,k+r) &= \BFl^T \BFT^{r+k-1} \BFL(1,0) \\
      &= -(a_{r-1} L(m,k+r-1) + \dots + a_1 L(m,k+1) + a_0 L(m,k))
    \end{split}
  \]
  for all $k \geq 1$, proving the theorem.
\end{proof}

By expressing $\BFT$ in terms of state classes rather than states,
and modifying $\BFl^T$ and $\BFL(1,0)$ accordingly
(as illustrated in section \ref{1xn-boards}),
we obtain a stronger upperbound on the order, namely the number of valid
$0$-state classes as given in Table~\ref{borderstates}.
Finally, that bound may be nearly halved again by exploiting the up-down
symmetry of $0$-states.

The structure of solutions to linear recurrences
is well known~\cite{concretemath}.
Theorem~\ref{recurrence} implies

\begin{coro}
  \label{explicit-form}
  For fixed $m$, $L(m,n)$ can be written in the form
  \[
    L(m,n) = \sum_k q_k(n) l_k^n,
  \]
  where $l_k$ are the distinct eigenvalues of $\BFT$, and $q_k$ are
  polynomials of degree at most $\mbox{multiplicity}(l_k)-1$. 
\end{coro}

Notice that some of the terms may vanish but not the largest
eigenvalue, which we have additional information about. First a
technical lemma is needed.

\begin{lemma}
  \label{jordan-lemma}
  If $l_k \ne 0$ is an eigenvalue of $\BFT$ of multiplicity 1 with
  corresponding left and right eigenvectors $\mathbf{e}^T$ and
  $\mathbf{f}$ then $q_k$ is the constant $\frac{\BFl^T \mathbf{f}
    \mathbf{e}^T \BFL(1,0)}{l_k}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\BFT = \mathbf{V} \mathbf{J} \mathbf{V}^{-1}$ be the Jordan
  canonical decomposition of $\BFT$. Thus $L(m,n) = \BFl^T \BFT^{n-1}
  \BFL(1,0) = \BFl^T \mathbf{V} \mathbf{J}^{n-1} \mathbf{V}^{-1}
  \BFL(1,0)$. Since $l_k$ has multiplicity one, it must have a single
  corresponding Jordan block of size 1. Due to the structure of $J$
  only this block can provide $l_k^n$ terms to $L(m,n)$, more
  precisely $\BFl^T e l_k^{n-1} f^T \BFL(1,0)$
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}
\label{mxn-asymptotics}
  There exist $a_m>0$, $0<\lambda_m \leq 3^m$, and $0<\phi_m<1$ such that
  \[ L(m,n)=a_m \lambda_m^n (1+r(m,n)) \]
  with $r(m,n)=O(\phi_m^n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By lemma \ref{connected-border-graph} it
follows that $\BFT$ is regular, i.e.\ $\BFT^k$ is (elementwise)
positive for some $k$. Since, by construction, $\BFT$ is also
non-negative, the Perron-Frobenius theorem guarantees the existence of a
real positive eigenvalue $l_1$ with the properties that it has
multiplicity one, is larger in magnitude than all other eigenvalues,
and has left and right eigenvectors $\mathbf{e}^T$ and $\mathbf{f}$
with all elements positive. From Lemma~\ref{jordan-lemma} it follows
that $q_1(n) = \frac{\BFl^T \mathbf{f} \mathbf{e}^T \BFL(1,0)}{l_k}$,
which is guaranteed to be a positive constant since $\BFl^T$ and
$\BFL(1,0)$ are non-negative and not all zero whereas $\mathbf{e}$ and
$\mathbf{f}$ are positive. Now $L(m,n) = q_1 l_1^n (1 + \sum_{k>1}
\frac{q_k(n)}{q_1} \frac{l_k}{l_1}^n)$ and the claimed result follows
(for any $\max_{k>1} \frac{|l_k|}{l_1}<\phi_m<1$). The upper bound on
$\lambda_m$ follows necessarily from the trivial upper bound
$L(m,n) \leq 3^{mn}$.
\end{proof}

The recursion coefficients are most easily obtained by
computing $L(m,n)$ for $n=1,\dots,2s$
by the dynamic programming algorithm in section
\ref{DP-algorithm}. Since we know that the sequence must satisfy
\emph{some} linear recurrence, the problem is reduced to determining the
minimal order and the corresponding coefficients. Moreover, we know
that the minimal order is upper-bounded by the number of valid state
classes $s$ given in Table~\ref{borderstates}.

\begin{lemma}
\label{coefficient-lemma}
  Assume that the sequence $x(1), x(2), \dots$ satisfies the linear
  recurrence
  \[
    x(k+r) = c_{r-1} x(k+r-1) + \dots + c_1 x(k+1) + c_0 x(k).
  \]
  Then the coefficients $c_i$ satisfy the equation system
  \[
    \begin{pmatrix}
      x(1) & x(2) & \dots & x(r) \\
      x(2) & x(3) & \dots & x(r+1) \\
      \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      x(r) & x(r+1) & \dots & x(2r-1) \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      c_0 \\ c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_{r-1}
    \end{pmatrix} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      x(r+1) \\ x(r+2) \\ \vdots \\ x(2r)
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \]
  Furthermore, $r$ is the minimal order of recurrence iff
  the above matrix is non-singular, in which case the coefficients
  are uniquely determined.
\end{lemma}

As we do not know the minimal order of recurrence, we form
matrices for increasing $r$. For each non-singular one, we
compute the recurrence coefficients and verify the recurrence for
all $s$ elements $L(m,s+1)$ through $L(m,2s)$.
The smallest verifiable $r$ is the minimal order.
For efficient computations, the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm
\cite{B83} can be used together with modular arithmetic and the
Chinese Remainder Theorem.

\subsubsection{$1 \times n$ Boards}
\label{1xn-boards}

For one-dimensional boards, with $m=1$, Figure~\ref{onebordergraph} shows
the five possible border
states ``empty'', ``black with liberty'', ``white with liberty'',
``black without liberty'', and ``white without liberty''. The first
three are legal, so $\BFl = (1,1,1,0,0)^T$. The state count
transformation is given by the transposed adjacency matrix
\[
  \BFT =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}
\]
and the initial state count with one column gives $\BFL(1,0) = (1,0,0,1,1)^T$.
In this case $\BFT$ is invertible and we can write
$\BFL(0,0) = \BFT^{-1} \BFL(1,0) = (-1,1,1,0,0)^T$ and
\[
  L(1,n) = \BFl^T \BFT^{n-1} \BFL(1,0)= \BFl^T \BFT^n \BFL(0,0) =
\]
\[
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1
  \end{pmatrix}^n
  \begin{pmatrix}
    -1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 
  \end{pmatrix},
\]
which gives the sequence $1,5,15,41,113,313,867,2401,6649,18413,\dots$

The characteristic polynomial of $\BFT$ is
$p(\lambda)=\det(\lambda \mathbf{I} - \BFT) =
\lambda^5 - 5\lambda^4 + 8\lambda^3 - 6\lambda^2 + 3\lambda - 1$. It
follows that $L(1,n)$ satisfies the recurrence
\[
  L(1,k+5) = 5 L(1,k+4) - 8 L(1,k+3) + 6 L(1,k+2) - 3 L(1,k+1) + L(1,k).
\]
This is not a minimal order recurrence, however. Using state classes
instead (empty, stone with liberty, or stone without liberty) yields
\begin{align*}
  \BFl &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}^T, \\
  \BFT &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 \\
    2 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 1 \\
  \end{pmatrix},\\
  \BFL(1,0) &=
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 2
  \end{pmatrix}^T
\end{align*}
and a characteristic polynomial $p(\lambda) = \lambda^3 - 3 \lambda^2
+ \lambda - 1$, leading to the minimal recurrence
\[
  L(1,k+3) = 3 L(1,k+2) - L(1,k+1) + L(1,k).
\]

These coefficients can also be computed directly from $L(1,1), \dots,
L(1,6)$ according to Lemma~\ref{coefficient-lemma} as
\[
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 5 & 15 \\
    5 & 15 & 41 \\
    15 & 41 & 113
  \end{pmatrix}^{-1}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    41 \\ 113 \\ 313
  \end{pmatrix} =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 \\ -1 \\ 3
  \end{pmatrix}.
\]

$L(1,n)$ can be written in the form of Corollary~\ref{explicit-form} as
\[
  \begin{split}
    L(1,n) &\sim 0.694 \cdot 2.769^n + (0.153 - 0.812 i) \cdot (0.115 + 0.590
    i)^n + \\
    &+ (0.153 + 0.812 i) \cdot (0.115 - 0.590 i)^n,    
  \end{split}
\]
where the constants involved are solutions to cubic equations. In
particular the largest eigenvalue can be written in closed form as
\[
  \lambda_1 = 1 + \frac{1}{3} \left( (27+3\sqrt{57})^{\frac{1}{3}} +
    (27-3\sqrt{57})^{\frac{1}{3}} \right) \sim 2.769292354.
\]

\subsubsection{$2 \times n$ up to $9 \times n$ Boards}

For $2 \times n$ boards, Table~\ref{borderstates} shows 9 state classes,
but up-down symmetry leaves an upper bound on the minimal recurrence order
of only 7, which turns out to be exact:
\[
  \begin{split}
    L(2,n+7) &= 10 L(2,n+6) - 16 L(2,n+5) + 31 L(2,n+4) -13 L(2,n+3) +
    \\
    &+ 20 L(2,n+2) + 2 L(2,n+1) - L(2,n).
  \end{split}
\]
This sequence starts $1,5,57,489,4125,35117,299681,\ldots$.

For $3 \times n$ the number of constructible state classes is 31, which up-down
symmetry reduces to 21, but the minimal recurrence order is only 19:
\[
  \begin{split}
    L(3,n+19) &= 33 L(3,n+18) - 233 L(3,n+17) + 1171 L(3,n+16) - \\
    &- 3750 L(3,n+15) + 9426 L(3,n+14) - 16646 L(3,n+13) + \\
    &+ 22072 L(3,n+12) - 19993 L(3,n+11) + 9083 L(3,n+10) + \\
    &+ 1766 L(3,n+9) - 4020 L(3,n+8) + 6018 L(3,n+7) - \\
    &- 2490 L(3,n+6) - 5352 L(3,n+5) + 1014 L(3,n+4) - \\
    &- 1402 L(3,n+3) + 100 L(3,n+2) + 73 L(3,n+1) - 5 L(3,n).
  \end{split}
\]
%The first 19 terms are 1,15,489,12675,321689,8180343,208144601, 5296282323,

The recurrences for $m \geq 4$ are too long to show here. Minimal
orders and the $\lambda_m$ values from theorem \ref{mxn-asymptotics}
are listed in Table~\ref{small-board-recurrences} for $1 \leq m \leq 9$.

\subsubsection{Legal Probabilities and Markov Chains}

Dividing the number of legal positions $L(m,n)$ by the total number of
positions $3^{mn}$ gives the probability that a random position on an
$m \times n$ board is legal. With this interpretation, it is natural to
consider the distribution of border states as a Markov Chain. First,
however, it is necessary to extend the border state space with
``illegal'' states (one for each partial column size)
which represent partial boards that aren't pseudolegal,
and make all states have outdegree $3$.
With this modification, the vectors $\BFp(m,n) = \frac{1}{3^{mn}}
\BFL(m,n,0)$ are probability distributions over the border states
and $\mathbf{P}_m = \frac{1}{3^m} \BFT_m$ is a probability
transition matrix, so that $\BFp(m,n+1) = \mathbf{P}_m \BFp(m,n)$
describes the change in distribution of border states
when a new random column is added. Since $\mathbf{P}_m$ is a
stochastic matrix, i.e. the sum of all columns is one, it has a
largest eigenvalue of 1. The corresponding eigenvector has a 1 for the
``illegal'' state and zero for all others, i.e.\ the illegal state is
an absorbing state, which is not surprising since
pseudolegality can only get lost under board extension, not regained.

\subsection{The Dynamic Programming algorithm}
\label{DP-algorithm}

The algorithm starts from the unit state vector $\BFL(m,0,0)$
(which has a 1 for the all-edge state only),
and then performs $mn$ linear transformations
(the first $m$ of which operate on edge states, while the rest,
of the form $\BFT_{m,y}$, operate on border states)
to obtain $\BFL(m,n,0)$.
Instead of keeping exact counts $L(m,n,y,s)$ as vector elements,
we use state class counts modulo some number $M$ close to $2^{64}$.
Running the algorithm $\lceil mn \log_2(3) / 64\rceil$
times with different, relatively prime, moduli
gives us a set of equations \[L(m,n) = a_i \bmod M_i,\]
which is readily solved using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT).
This technique trades off memory and diskspace (which are more constrained)
for time. There is an interesting side-benefit of using chinese remaindering:
automatic error detection. If, for instance,
a single bitflip in memory should corrupt one of the remainders,
then reconstruction of the full count from the remainders will yield
a value that's way off, which will be obvious when comparing with the
approximation formula we'll derive in a later section.

The heart of the algorithm is an efficient representation of
border state classes, using just 3 bits per point, or $3m$ bits for
a state class. This makes the standard height of $m=19$ fit
comfortably in 64-bit integers.
The non-crossing connections can be represented with just 2 booleans
per libertyless stone: whether it has a connection above it, and whether
it has a connection below it.
The representation further exploits the fact that neighbouring points
in the border highly constrain each other. Figure~\ref{borderdfa}
shows possible transitions from one point to the next in a ``bump-free''
$0$-state. Upward and downward pointing arrows from the line
indicating lack of liberties represent the two boolean flags.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\epsfxsize=10cm \epsfbox{borderdfa.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Intra-border transitions.}
\label{borderdfa}
\end{figure}

Edges between boxed sets of points indicate the presence of edges from all
points in one set to all points in the other.
Next to each point is shown its 3-bit code. Note that no point
has two different transitions to same numbered points. 
This reflects the fact that two libertyless adjacent stones have the same
color if and only if they are connected, and a stone with liberties cannot
be adjacent to a libertyless stone of the same color.
The algorithm uses code 0 for `edge' points in edge states.
Two pieces of information are still lacking; the color of a libertyless
stone at $(x,0)$, and the color of a libertyless stone on $(x-1,y)$, which
is not adjacent to the previous border point at $(x,y-1)$.
However, since we represent state classes rather than states, we can
assume that $(x-1,y)$, if non-empty, is always white.
In this case, the color of a libertyless stone at $(x,0)$ can be stored
in the boolean indicating connections above, since the latter is always false.
If $(x-1,y)$ is empty, then we can assume any stone on $(x,0)$ is white.
If both $(x-1,y)$ and $(x,0)$ are empty then we can normalize
the color of e.g. the bottom-most stone on the border.

In order to compute $\BFL(m,n,y+1) = \BFT_{m,y} \BFL(m,n,y)$,
the algorithm loops over all state-count pairs $(s,i)$ in $\BFL(m,n,y)$,
computes the 2 or 3 successors $s'$ of $s$, and stores the new pairs
$(s',i)$ in some data structure.
Matching pairs $(s',i)$ and $(s',j)$ need to be combined into a single
pair $(s',i+j \bmod M)$, which is easy if all states can be kept in memory.
For large computations, like $m=19$, this is not possible and the
state-count pairs need to be stored on disk. To allow for efficient combining
of states, we collect as many pairs as possible in memory, before flushing
them all to disk in sorted order. To save space, we store only the differences
between consecutive states (using 7 bits per byte, with
the 8th bit indicating the last byte).
Note that a state can appear in as many files as it has
predecessors in $\BFL(m,n,y)$.
The total number of state-count-pairs in all output files is thus
larger than the number of $(y+1)$-states by a factor in the range $[1,3]$.
This {\em redundancy} is the average number of files in which
a $(y+1)$-state occurs. Merging all output files while combining like pairs
removes this redundancy and produces the required $\BFL(m,n,y+1)$.
To keep redundancy small, we want
the different predecessors of a state to be close together
in the input ordering, so that combination can take place before
a memory flush.
This ordering depends on how the $m$ 3-bit fields are joined into a
$3m$ bit integer. We do this in different ways, such that the most variable
fields, namely, those close to $y$, end in up the less significant
bits of the $3m$ bit integer.

It turns out that the computation of $\BFT_{m,y}$ as described above,
{\em precisely} fits the Google {\em MapReduce} framework described
in~\cite{DG04}. Our map function maps a state-count pair $(s,i)$ to a
list of 2 or 3 new pairs $(s',i)$, while our reduce function merely
sums modulo $M$.

Having completed all $mn$ linear transformations,
which gives us $\BFL(m,n,0)$, we then sum all counters of legal
states to get the desired $L(m,n) \bmod M$ result.

\subsection{Complexity}
The main factor in both time and space complexity is the number of
state classes $s$. This may be upperbounded by ignoring the
connection constraints (equivalent to balancing parentheses) and
computing the largest eigenvalue of the intra-border transition matrix,
which turns out to be $\lambda \sim 5.372$ (the largest root
of $(\lambda-2)(\lambda^2-5\lambda-2)$). The number of paths
of length $m$ through the intra-border transition graph, and hence $s$,
is therefore bounded by $O(\lambda^m)$. 
We thus need at most $\lambda^m(3m+64)$ bits plus the
overhead for the datastructure which is at most linear,
for a space complexity of $O(m \lambda^m)$.

For time complexity, we have the product of the number of moduli,
which is $\lceil mn \log_2(3) / 64\rceil$, the number $mn$ of passes,
the number $O(\lambda^m)$ of states, and the amount of work $O(m)$ per state,
which results in time $O(m^3 n^2 \lambda^m)$.

Table~\ref{legalcounts} shows the number of legal positions.
As the computational complexity suggests, the $L(17,17)$ result
took more effort than previous combined.
The computation took over 8000 CPU-hours and 3TB of disk space,
generously provided by the Opteron based Linux Cluster of the INS group
at the Center for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in Amsterdam.

A few more months of computing were spent by other people trying to
factor the number following its announcement on {\tt rec.games.go} on
August 18, 2006.
The smallest factor of $46542825577$ was easy to find but the remaining
126 digit composite number proved a hard nut to crack.
Thanks to Paul Leyland and the General Number Field
Sieve, the middle factor of $2518026579235045782504604934907161589529$
was found by December 23, 2006.

\subsection{Heuristic Sampling Results}
Pang Chen~\cite{C92}, improving on earlier work of Knuth and Purdom,
developed an elegant unbiased estimator of treesize that takes
advantage of heuristic knowledge in the form of a stratifier.
This is a function on tree nodes which must decrease when following
tree edges, and which should correlate with subtree size, since
this determines the estimator variance.
Pang demonstrated the power
of his Heuristic Sampling algorithm on the problem of counting
uncrossed knight's tours on a chess board.
As stratifier he used the number of unvisited squares reachable by
{\em currently valid} knight moves.

We applied his technique to the problem of counting legal positions
by estimating
the size of the tree of successive border states to depth $n^2$.
As stratifier we use the pair (remaining depth,
$m$ minus the number of libertyless strings).
For each boardsize of interest, we took the average of
between $10^5$ and $10^7$ runs of the Heuristic Sampling algorithm,
with the results shown in Table~\ref{samplingcounts}.

\subsection{Asymptotic Bounds}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\epsfxsize=9cm \epsfbox{knight.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Knight subset of points on $5 \times 5$ and $10 \times 10$ boards.}
\label{knight}
\end{figure}

Let $K$ denote the set of points on an $m \times n$ board,
reachable from one (3,3) point with `orthogonal'
knight moves, as shown in Figure~\ref{knight}. For simplicity,
assume that $m$ and $n$ are divisible by $5$, so that set $K$ has size $mn/5$
(for other $m,n$, $|K|$ equals $mn/5$ rounded up or down).
We use $K$ to derive both lower and upper bounds on $L(m,n)$.

\begin{theorem}
\label{asymp}
For $m,n$ divisible by 5,
\[ 3^\frac{4mn}{5}(1-\frac{2}{81})^\frac{2(m+n)}{5} \leq L(m,n) \leq
   3^{ mn  }(1-\frac{2}{81})^\frac{2(m+n)}{5}(1-\frac{2}{243})^\frac{mn-2(m+n)}{5}. \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
For the lower bound, color the points in $K$ empty, and all other
points randomly. Then illegality can only arise at the $2(m+n)/5$
points on the edge that neither belong to $K$ nor neighbour $K$. 
For each such point, the probability of being a libertyless stone
is $2\cdot 3^{-4}=2/81$, and these events are independent,
so the whole position is legal with probability $(1-2/81)^{2(m+n)/5}$.

For the upper bound, we color all points randomly and only check if any
point in $K$ is a one-stone string without liberties.
For each of the $2(m+n)/5$ edge points
of $K$ this happens with probability $2/81$ and for each of the
$mn/5-2(m+n)/5$ interior points of $K$ this happens with probability
$2\cdot 3^{-5}=2/243$. Again, these events are all independent.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The base of liberties}

The previous section shows that $L(m,n)^{1/mn}$ is roughly
between $3^{4/5} \sim 2.4$ and $3(1-\frac{2}{243})^{1/5} \sim 2.995$.
In this section we prove that $L(m,n)^{1/mn}$ in fact converges to
a specific value $L$, which we call the {\em base of liberties}.
This is the 2-dimensional analogue of the 1-dimensional growth rate
$\lambda_1 \sim 2.7693$ derived in Section~\ref{1xn-boards}.

Fix $m$ and $n$. Consider any $M=q_m m + r_m$ and
$N=q_n n + r_n$ with $0\leq r_m < m, 0\leq r_n < n$.
Since tiling legal positions together preserves legality, we have
\[ L(M,N) \geq L(m,n)^{q_m q_n} L(m,r_n)^{q_m} L(r_m,n)^{q_n} L(r_m,r_n). \]
This proves

\begin{theorem}
$\ln L(m,n)$ is superadditive in both arguments.
\label{super-additive}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
$\lim_{\min(m,n)\rightarrow \infty} L(m,n)^{1/m n}$ converges to some value $L$.
\label{base-of-liberties}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We extend the proof of Fekete's theorem to 2 dimensions:
\[ \liminf_{M,N\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\ln L(M,N)}{M N} \geq
\liminf_{M,N\rightarrow \infty} \frac{q_m q_n}{M N} \ln L(m,n)
+ \frac{q_m}{M N} \ln L(m,r_n) + \]
\[ + \frac{q_n}{M N} \ln L(r_m,n)
+ \frac{1}{M N}\ln L(r_m,r_n) = \frac{\ln L(m,n)}{m n}. \]
Since $m$ and $n$ were arbitrary, we get
\[ \liminf_{M,N\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\ln L(M,N)}{M N} \geq
\sup_{m,n \geq 1} \frac{\ln L(m,n)}{m n}, \]
hence $\frac{\ln L(m,n)}{m n}$ converges to some value $\ln L$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{An Asymptotic Formula}

Theorems~\ref{base-of-liberties} and \ref{mxn-asymptotics}
together imply that $a_m^{1/mn} \lambda_m^{1/m}$,
and hence $\lambda_m^{1/m}$
(since $n$ can go to infinity arbitrarily faster than $m$),
converge to $L$.
Table~\ref{small-board-recurrences} confirms that the $\lambda_m$
values behave roughly as $L^m$ for some $L$.
In this section we extend Theorem~\ref{mxn-asymptotics}
to derive a much stronger result, albeit contingent on a
conjecture about how fast the subdominant terms disappear. The central
idea is that since $\ln(L(m,n))$ is asymptotically linear in $n$ for
each $m$, and symmetric, it can be expected to be asymptotically
bilinear in $m$ and $n$.

The parameters guaranteed by Theorem~\ref{mxn-asymptotics}
may be obtained from $L()$ as follows:

\begin{coro}
  \[
  \begin{split}
    \lambda_m &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{L(m,n+1)}{L(m,n)}, \\
    a_m &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{L(m,n)}{\lambda_m^n}, \\
    r(m,n) &= \frac{L(m,n)}{a_m^{} \lambda_m^n} - 1.
  \end{split}
  \]
\end{coro}

In practice the $\phi_m$ values are small enough that a number of
$a_m$, $\lambda_m$, and $r(m,n)$ can be computed with good accuracy
from the $L(m,n)$ values that are practical to compute by the dynamic
programming algorithm. Before looking further at these we derive a
number of lemmas about symmetric and asymptotically linear functions.
Recall that the discrete derivative $\Delta$ is defined by
$\Delta f(n) = f(n+1)-f(n)$.

First a discrete integration result
needed in Lemma~\ref{asymptotically-linear-m};

\begin{lemma}
  \label{technical-lemma}
  If $\Delta g(n) = O(\phi^n)$ for some $0 \leq \phi < 1$
  then $g(n) = \gamma + O(\phi^n)$ for some $\gamma$.
  Likewise $\Delta g(n) = O(n\phi^n)$
  implies $g(n) = \gamma + O(n \phi^n)$ for some $\gamma$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Since $\sum_{i\geq n} \Delta g(i) = O(\sum_{i\geq n} \phi^i) = O(\phi^n)$,
  $\lim_{n->\infty}g(n)$ converges to some value $\gamma$, and the conclusion
  follows.
  The other case is similar, with convergence implied by
  $\sum_{i\geq n} i\phi^i =
  \frac{n\phi^n}{1-\phi}+\frac{\phi^{n+1}}{(1-\phi)^2} = O(n\phi^n)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{symmetric-asymptotically-linear-n}
  Let $x(m,n) = u(m) + n v(m) + w(m,n)$ be symmetric. Then
  \[ \Delta^2 v(n) = v(n+2)-2v(n+1)+v(n) = w(n+1,n+2)-w(n+2,n+1) \]
  \[ + w(n,n+1)-w(n+1,n) - w(n,n+2) + w(n+2,n) \]
  and
  \[ \Delta u(n) = -n v(n+1) + (n+1) v(n) - w(n+1,n) + w(n,n+1). \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \[
  \begin{split}
    0 &= x(n+2,n+1)-x(n+1,n+2) \\
&\phantom{=} + x(n+1,n)-x(n,n+1) + x(n,n+2)-x(n+2,n) \\
    &= u(n+2)+(n+1)v(n+2)+w(n+2,n+1) \\
&\phantom{=} -u(n+1)-(n+2)v(n+1)-w(n+1,n+2) \\
&\phantom{=} +u(n+1)+nv(n+1)+w(n+1,n) - u(n)-(n+1)v(n)-w(n,n+1) \\
&\phantom{=} +u(n)+(n+2)v(n)+w(n,n+2) - u(n+2)-nv(n+2)-w(n+2,n) \\
    &= v(n+2) -2v(n+1) + v(n) -w(n+1,n+2)+w(n+2,n+1) \\
    &\phantom{=} -w(n,n+1)+w(n+1,n) +w(n,n+2)-w(n+2,n),
  \end{split}
  \]
  \[
  \begin{split}
    0 &= x(n+1,n) - x(n,n+1) \\
      & = u(n+1) + n v(n+1) + w(n+1,n) - u(n) - (n+1) v(n) - w(n,n+1).
  \end{split}
  \]
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  \label{asymptotically-linear-m}
  If additionally all $w()$ terms in the above are $O(\phi^n)$
  for some $\phi < 1$, then there exist 
  $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\lambda$ such that
  \[
  \begin{split}
    v(m) &= \beta + \lambda m + O(\phi^m), \\
    u(m) &= \alpha + \beta m + O(m \phi^m).
  \end{split}
  \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Lemma~\ref{symmetric-asymptotically-linear-n} together with
  the assumption give $\Delta^2 v(n) = O(\phi^n)$.
  Applying Lemma~\ref{technical-lemma} once to $g(n)=\Delta v(n)$ gives
  $\Delta v(n) = \lambda + O(\phi^n)$ and applying it again to
  $g(n)=v(n)-\lambda n$ gives $v(n)=\beta+\lambda n+O(\phi^n)$.
  
  Lemma~\ref{symmetric-asymptotically-linear-n} also gives
  \[
  \begin{split}
    \Delta u(n) &= -n v(n+1) + (n+1) v(n) - w(n+1,n) + w(n,n+1) \\
    &= -n (\beta + \lambda (n+1) + O(\phi^{n+1}))
        + (n+1)(\beta + \lambda n + O(\phi^n)) + O(\phi^n) \\
    &= \beta + O(n \phi^n).
  \end{split}
  \]
  
  A third application of Lemma~\ref{technical-lemma} to
  $g(n)=u(n)-\beta n$ gives $u(n) = \alpha + \beta n + O(n \phi^n)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{coro}
  \label{asymptotically-bilinear}
  Under the assumptions above, for $n=\Theta(m)$,
  \[ x(m,n) = \alpha + \beta(m + n) + \lambda mn + O(m\phi^m). \]
  %for both $m$ and $n$ large.
\end{coro}

%A sharper bound on $w(m,n)$ gives the stronger result that $v(m)$ must
%be exactly linear, not only asymptotically linear.

%\begin{lemma}
%  \label{too-strong-bound}
%  If also $|w(m,n)| < C \phi^n$, for some $C>0$ and all $m,n$, then
%  \[
%  v(m) = \beta + \lambda m.
%  \]
%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{proof}
%  \[
%  \begin{split}
%    0 &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} (\frac{x(m,n)}{n} -
%    \frac{x(n,m)}{n}) \\
%    &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}(\frac{u(m)}{n} + v(m) +
%    \frac{w(m,n)}{n} - \frac{u(n)}{n} - \frac{m v(n)}{n} - 
%    \frac{w(n,m)}{n}) \\
%    &= v(m) - \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{u(n)}{n} - m \lim_{n
%      \rightarrow \infty} \frac{v(n)}{n} = v(m) - \beta - \lambda m
%  \end{split}
%  \]
%\end{proof}

Taking natural logarithms of the expression for $L(m,n)$ in
Theorem~\ref{mxn-asymptotics} we have
\[
\ln(L(m,n)) = \ln(a_m) + n \ln(\lambda_m) + \ln(1+r(m,n)),
\]
which is in the expected form with $x(m,n) = \ln(L(m,n))$,
$u(m) = \ln(a_m)$, $v(m) = \ln(\lambda_m)$, and $w(m,n) =
\ln(1+r(m,n))$. The question is whether $\ln(1+r(m,n))$ satisfies
the conditions on $w()$ in the lemmas.

Although one can show that for fixed $m$,
$\ln(L(m,n)) - \alpha - \beta(m + n) - \lambda mn = \Omega(n)$,
%Gunnar: we shldn't mention alpha and beta that are only guaranteed
%to exist for vanishing r(m,n)
%We also need to refer to and explain the plots above,
%in particular the parameter d and the meaning of the y-axis.
we do expect this quantity to vanish for proportional $n$:

\begin{conj}
  \label{conjecture}
  $r(m,n) = O(\phi^m)$ for some $\phi < 1$ and  $n=\Theta(m)$.
\end{conj}

(This should be read as: for any constant $c \geq 1$,
 there exists a $\phi < 1$ such that
 $r(m,n) = O(\phi^m)$ for all $m/c \leq n \leq cm$.)
This assumption suffices to apply
Corollary~\ref{asymptotically-bilinear} to $\ln L(m,\Theta(m))$,
which, after exponentiation, gives

\begin{theorem}
Conjecture~\ref{conjecture} implies
  \label{asymptotic-formula}
  \[
  L(m,n) = A\,\, B^{m+n} L^{mn} (1+O(m\phi^m))
  \]
  for some constants $A$, $B$, $\phi<1$, and $n=\Theta(m)$.
\end{theorem}

The constants $A$, $B$, and $L$ can all be computed as limits of
expressions involving legal counts of square and almost-square boards.

\begin{coro}[contingent on Conjecture~\ref{conjecture}]
  \[
  \begin{split}
    L &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{L(n,n)L(n+1,n+1)}{L(n,n+1)^2}, \\
    B &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{L(n,n+1)}{L(n,n)L^n}
      = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}
    \frac{L(n,n)}{L(n,n-1)L^n}, \\ 
    A &= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}
    \frac{L(n,n)}{B^{2n} L^{n^2}}.

Of course $L$ could also be approximated according to its definition

Although the formula for $L(m,n)$ is only asymptotic, the convergence
turns out to be quite fast. Compared to the exact results in
Table~\ref{legalcounts}, it achieves relative accuracy $0.99993$ at $n=5$,
$0.99999999$ at $n=9$, and $1.00000000000025$ at $n=13$. It is
consistent with all the simulated results. For $n=99$ it gives the
same result of $4 \cdot 10^{4638}$.
Accuracy is also excellent far away from the diagonal.
E.g., at $L(7,268)$, the relative accuracy is still 1.0000007,
witnessing the wide range of application of Theorem~\ref{asymptotic-formula}.

For $19 \times 19$, the formula gives $2.08168199382 \cdot 10^{170}$,
of which we can expect all digits to be correct.

\section{Comparison with other games}
\label{othergames}
In Go, the question of what constitutes a legal position
is very easy to decide. Not so in some other popular
games. In Chess there are so called problems of {\em retrograde analysis},
which ask how a position could have possibly arisen. Anyone having
tried these problems can appreciate their complexity.
But even in as simple a game as Connect-4, the problem
of deciding if a position could have legally arisen, can be shown to
be NP-hard~\cite{GW}. In such cases we cannot hope to find exact counts
and need to settle for upper bounds.

For Chess, a straightforward Huffman encoding
(ignoring history attributes such as castling rights) gives an upperbound of
$2^{32\cdot1 + 2(8\cdot 3+6\cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 6)}
= 2^{164} \sim 2.3 \cdot 10^{49}$
positions, a number in between $L(10,10)$ and $L(11,11)$.

For Connect-4 played on a board with $n$ columns of height $m$, each column
can be encoded in $m+1$ bits, giving an upperbound of $2^{n(m+1)}$ positions.

Gomoku, also known as Go-bang, is more closely related to Go.
The goal in Gomoku is to obtain 5 consecutive
stones of one's color along an orthogonal or diagonal line.
We could thus define a legal position as one
in which no 5 same colored stones appear in a row (ignoring the required
near-equality of numbers of black and white stones, or allowing the option
of passing).
This could be computed exactly with a Dynamic Programming algorithm,
with states comprising a 4 row thick border. The resulting state space
size of $3^{4m}$ however limits the approach to $m=6$ or so. 
The alternative of using the inclusion-exclusion formula to count
the illegal positions is similarly limited, since a $6 \times 6$ board
already has 32 possible 5-in-a-rows, all subsets of which have to be
considered.

We note that in contrast to Theorem~\ref{super-additive},
the function $\ln L(m,n)$ for Gomuku is {\em subadditive}, from which
Theorem~\ref{base-of-liberties} can be similarly derived.
Under a naive assumption of independence of events,
the ``base of gomoku'' would have a value of
$1+2(1-\frac{1}{3}^4)^4 \sim 2.90$, much less than for Go.
%Gunnar: an event here is a stone being the rightmost (or toprightmost/
% topmost/topleftmost) of a 5 in-a-row. Please check

\section{Counting games}
\subsection{Exact values}
By Lemma~\ref{gamepaths}, the number of games equals the number of simple
paths in the game graph. For very small boards, we can find these
numbers by brute force enumeration, as shown in Table~\ref{numberofgames}.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
$m \setminus n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ \hline
1 & 1 & 9 & 907 & 2098407841 & $\sim 10^{31}$ & $\sim 10^{100}$ \\
2 & & 386356909593 & $\sim 10^{86}$ & $10^{\sim 5.3\cdot 10^2}$ & & \\
3 & & & $10^{\sim 1.1\cdot 10^3}$ & & & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Exact and estimated number of games on small boards.}
\label{numberofgames}
\end{table}

\subsection{Approximation}
Just as with legal positions, we can estimate the size of the game tree,
and hence the number of games, using Heuristic Sampling.
A natural stratifier,
similar to the one used by Pang Chen for uncrossed knight tours,
is the number of positions reachable through {\em currently unvisited}
positions.  Using this stratifier, we obtained the
estimates shown in Table~\ref{numberofgames}, with the location of the
$\sim$-symbol indicating (un)certainty about the order of magnitude.
%Unfortunately, the larger numbers are bound to be inaccurate, since
%the variance can be very large. As an extreme case, consider a
%full binary tree of depth $m$ and size $2^{m+1}-1$ one of whose leaves
%is replaced by a full binary tree of depth $n$ and size $2^{n+1}-1$.
%The variance is $2^{-m} (2^{m+n+1}-1-\mu)^2+(1-2^{-m})(2^{m+1}-1-\mu)^2=
%\Theta(2^{m+2n})$, giving a standard deviation of $\Theta(2^n \sqrt{2^m})$,
%which is exponentially larger than the size of the tree. This suggests that
%it is easy to overestimate the tree size. But underestimates are no less
%likely, since simulation may never get into the deep but bushy parts of
%the game tree.

\subsection{Upper bounds}
We can relate the number of simple paths to the product of outdegrees.
First we need a technical lemma.

\begin{lemma}
\label{outdeg2}
On boards larger than $1\times 1$, every node in the game graph has
outdegree at least 2.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
For the empty position,
the Lemma holds by assumption on board size.
For other nodes, consider one of its strings. If this string
has at least two liberties, then these provide two legal moves for its owner.
If it has only one liberty, then the opponent can move there to capture, while
a move by the owner there cannot result in a single-stone suicide.
\end{proof}

Now consider the game tree, consisting of all simple paths. We want to
avoid internal nodes with only one child, so we make them binary
by duplicating their child subtree.
By Lemma~\ref{outdeg2}, the resulting tree still has no more than
$(\prod_v \mbox{outdeg}(v))/\mbox{mindeg}$ leaves,
where $\mbox{mindeg} \geq 2$ is the minimum outdegree.
Furthermore, since the tree is at least binary, it
must have fewer internal nodes than leaves. This proves

\begin{lemma}
The number of games on an $m \times n$ board with, $mn>1$, is at most
$\prod_v \mbox{outdeg}(v)$.
\end{lemma}

By Corollary~\ref{outdeg}, this is in turn bounded by $(2mn)^{L(m,n)}$.
Most positions have about $mn/3$ empty points though, and some of the moves
are illegal self-loops, so the average outdegree is much less than $2mn$.

\begin{theorem}
\label{games-upper-bound}
The number of games on an $m \times n$ board is at most $(mn)^{L(m,n)}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}
\hline
$m \setminus n$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
1     & 0 & 2.4   & 2.8   & 3.512 \\
2     &   & 3.368 & 4.728 & 6.208 \\
3     &   &       & 6.801 & 8.933 \\
4     &   &       &       & 11.741 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Average outdegree on small boards.}
\label{avgoutdeg}
\end{table}

\begin{proof}
The Theorem holds trivially for $mn=1$, which has only 1 position and 1 game,
and for $mn=2$, which has only 5 positions and 9 games.
Table~\ref{avgoutdeg} shows that for other small boards,
the average outdegree is smaller than $mn$.
By the Chernoff bounds on binomial tails, the fraction of legal positions with
at least $mn/2$ empty points diminishes exponentially on larger boards, for
which the average outdegree is close to $2mn/3$.
To complete the proof, note that the product of outdegrees
equals the $L(m,n)$'th power of their geometric average, which
is upperbounded by the arithmetic average.
\end{proof}

This bound is quite crude for small boards. For example,
the $1 \times 3$ board has an average outdegree of $\frac{42}{15}=2.8$,
an outdegree product of $3\cdot 2^{19}=1572864$ which is bounded by
$3^{15}=14348907$, while the actual number of games is only 907.

We conjecture that for any $mn \geq 3$, the number of games is less than
$(2mn/3)^{L(m,n)}$.
The fact that legal positions have on average more empty points than
arbitrary positions should be amply offset by the removal
of self-loops and, more importantly, the widening gap between
geometric and arithmetic averages.

\subsection{Lower bounds}
Note that the game graph need not be Hamiltonian, and constructing
a game visiting even $2^{mn}$ legal positions is a major
challenge (achievable for one-dimensional boards as we'll see later).
We can still get a nontrivial lower bound by visiting only
a highly structured subset of legal positions.

\begin{theorem}
\label{partition}
Suppose the $mn$ points on the board can be partitioned
into 3 sets $B,W,E$ such that
\begin{itemize}
\item
$|B|=|W|=k, |E|=l=mn-2k$,
\item
$B$ and $W$ are connected,
\item
each point in $E$ is adjacent to both $B$ and $W$.
\end{itemize}
Then there are at least $(k!)^{2^{l-1}}$ possible games,
all lasting over $k{2^{l-1}}$ moves.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
First we recall some properties of binary {\em Gray} codes.
The $1$ bit Gray code $G_1$ is $0,1$, while $G_{l+1}$ consists of $G_l$
in which each bitstring is extended with a 0,
followed by the reverse of $G_l$
in which each bitstring is extended with a 1.
Thus, $G_2 = 00,10,11,01$ and $G_3=000,100,110,010,011,111,101,001$.
Succesive strings differ in exactly one bit, and the sequence of bits
flipped is the so-called {\em binary carry schedule}
$0,1,0,2,0,1,0,3,0,1,0,2,\ldots$.
Consider the successive changes in Hamming weight.
Denote an increment by $+$ and a decrement by $-$.
Since the initial bit is flipped every other step,
every $4i$-th sign is $+$ while every $4i+2$-nd sign is $-$.
As a consequence, $G_l$ has $2^{l-1}-1$ sign changes.
Furthermore, the initial bit is 1 inbetween a change from $+$ to $-$,
and is 0 inbetween a change from $-$ to $+$.

Let $\{E_i\}_{0\leq i<2^l}$ be the sequence of all subsets of $E$
corresponding to the $l$-bit Gray code. 
Let $E_i^+$ be the position with only black stones on $B \cup E_i$ and
$E_i^-$ the position with only white stones on $W \cup (E \setminus E_i)$.
By the connectivity assumptions, these positions have only one string.
See Figure~\ref{gray3} for an illustration of the 3 bit Gray code
and corresponding positions.

We now construct games as follows: first play from the empty board to
$E_0^+$ in one of $k!$ ways. Then a black move takes us to
$E_1^+$, and another takes us to $E_2^+$. Since the sign changes to $-$,
we first move from $E_2^+$ to $E_2^-$ by letting white occupy all of $W$
in one of $k!$ ways and then occupy $E \setminus E_2$, capturing black.
Now a white
move takes us to $E_3^-$. In this way we transform each $+$ into a
black move, each $-$ into a white move, and each sign change into
a capture sequence. We get $k!$ choices at the start, and at
every sign change, for a total of $2^{l-1}$ times.

It remains to show that no position is repeated.
All $E_i^+,E_i^-$ positions are unique by construction.
During a change from $E_i^+$ to $E_i^-$, by the above observation on
sign changes, the point corresponding to the initial bit of
the Gray code is black, so all
intermediate positions can be uniquely associated with $E_i^+$.
Similarly, during a change from $E_j^-$ to $E_j^+$, that same point is
white and all intermediate positions can be uniquely associated
with $E_i^-$.
\end{proof}

There are between $2^{2^{n^2/2\,-O(n)}}$
and $2^{2^{n^2 \log 3+\log\log n + O(1)}}$
Go games on an $n\times n$ board,
\end{coro}

\begin{proof}
On a square board of size $n\equiv 3 \bmod 4$, the partition shown
in Figure~\ref{bwe} has parameters
$k=|B|=|W|=n-1+(n-2)(n+1)/4$ and $l=2+(n-2)(n-1)/2$, giving a lower bound
of $(k!)^{2^{l-1}} = 2^{2^{n^2/2\, -3n/2\,+\log k + \log \log k +O(1)}}$.
The upper bound follows from Theorem~\ref{games-upper-bound}.
\end{proof}

\begin{coro}
The number $N$ of $19 \times 19$ Go games is
\[ (103!)^{2^{154}} \leq N \leq 361^{0.012\cdot 3^{361}}, \]
in binary
\[ 2^{2^{163}} < N <2^{2^{569}}, \]
and in decimal
\[ 10^{10^{48}} < N <10^{10^{171}}. \]
\end{coro}

In one dimension, the conditions of Theorem~\ref{partition} can only
be met by taking $E$ a singleton set, giving a useless bound.
Fortunately, the highly structured nature of one-dimensional boards allows
us to prove much better bounds.

\begin{theorem}
There are at least $2^{2^{n-1}}$ games on an $1 \times n$ board with $n\geq 2$,
which last from $3\cdot 2^{n-1}-5$ up to $2^{n+1}-4$ moves.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Number the points $0,1,\ldots,n-1$ from left to right.
To any non-empty legal position we can assign a {\em predecessor}
in which the leftmost stone, say on point $i$, is replaced by
stones of the opposite color on points $0,1,\ldots,i-1$.
If we assign to each position the number $\sum_{i\mbox{ occupied}} 2^i$,
then the predecessor of a position is indeed numbered one less.
The predecessor relation defines a spanning tree of the game graph which we
call the {\em left-capturing} gametree, in which each legal
position occurs at a depth equal to its number. Figure~\ref{leftcap}
shows the left-capturing gametree for $n=3$.
This is a binary tree; each node has 0,1, or 2 children, since at most
2 positions can have the same predecessor.
The two positions at maximum depth $2^n-2$ have a single string
occupying all but the leftmost point. The path to such a position has
$2^{n-2}$ positions with point $0$ occupied and point $1$ empty.
Each of these latter positions could be skipped by moving directly
from its predecessor to its successor, yielding $2^{n-2}$ binary choices.
To double that amount, we consider games following both paths.
For odd $n\geq 3$, we can move directly
from the end of one path, e.g. {\tt .XXXX} to the second node {\tt O....}
of the other path.
For $n=2$, the Theorem is easily seen to hold.
For even $n \geq 4$, we can move from the 3rd-to-last node of one path,
e.g. {\tt ..XXXX}, to the skippable {\tt X.XXXX},
to the third node {\tt .O....} of the other path.
Either case gives us $2^{n-1}-1$ binary choices, since we lose
one choice at the start of the second path.
However, we also have a choice of which path to follow first,
giving us the required $2^{n-1}$ choices. The
shortest game is reached by skipping all on an even-sized board,
while the longest game is reached by skipping nothing on an odd-sized board.
\end{proof}

\section{Hamiltonian games}
The previous section showed the existence of games visiting a large
fraction of all positions. The question arises if and when it
is possible to have games encompassing {\em all} $L(m,n)$ legal
positions.
Inspired by graph theory, we call such games, as well as
the board they're played on, {\em Hamiltonian}.

\begin{theorem}
Only one-dimensional boards can be Hamiltonian.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Consider a $2 \times 2$ square on an $m \times n$ board with $m,n \geq 2$.
There are a total of 10 positions with all points
outside the square being black, and having in the square
either two opposite black stones
or two adjacent black stones and one white stone.
Yet there are only a total of 8 positions where they can move to, namely
4 positions with every point except one in the square being black,
plus the 4 positions with only two adjacent white stones in the square.
\end{proof}

The question remains which one-dimensional boards are hamiltonian.
This means that the graph $G(1,n)$ must have a directed
Hamiltonian path starting at the empty position. While
$G(1,1)$ trivially satisfies this, the graph $G(1,2)$
in Figure~\ref{G21} does not, since removing the starting node
disconnects it.

One sufficient condition for such a path is
for the graph minus the empty node to have a directed Hamiltonian
cycle, since we can break the cycle at any 1-stone position and insert
the empty node there. An even stronger condition is to have each
position opposite its reversed color version on the cycle. It turns
out that all cycles on $G(1,3)$ and $G(1,4)$ are of this form;
it suffices to show only half of the cycle, from which the other half
can be obtained by reversing colors:
\begin{verbatim} 
O..  O.O  .X.  XX.  ..O  X.O  .OO

O...  O..O  O.X.  .XX.  XXX.  ...O  X..O  X.X.  X.XX  .O..
.O.X  OO.X  ..XX  O.XX  OO..  OO.O  ..X.  .OX.  .O.O  .OOO
\end{verbatim} 

For larger graphs it becomes impossible to find such cycles manually,
and one has to turn to tools such as Concorde~\cite{concorde},
%available online~\cite{neos-concorde}
for solving Traveling Salesman Problems.

Here's how we translate our directed color symmetric cycle problem into
an undirected TSP. For each non-empty node $v \in G(m,n)$ whose
leftmost stone is white, we create the the 4 nodes and 4 edges shown in
Figure~\ref{gadget}. Then, for every move $(u,v)$ where $u$'s leftmost
stone is white, we create edges $\{u_{0}^{\mbox{out}},v_{0}^{\mbox{in}}\}$
and $\{u_{1}^{\mbox{out}},v_{1}^{\mbox{in}}\}$ if $v$'s leftmost
stone is white, or edges $\{u_{0}^{\mbox{out}},w_{1}^{\mbox{in}}\}$
and $\{u_{1}^{\mbox{out}},w_{0}^{\mbox{in}}\}$ if $v$'s leftmost
stone is black and $w$ is its color reversed version.
All these intra-gadget edges have cost 2.
Finally, we cross the pair of $1$-edges in one gadget. Call the resulting
weighted undirected graph on $4(L(m,n)-1)/2$ nodes $T(m,n)$.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\epsfxsize=4cm \epsfbox{gadget.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{A gadget.}
\label{gadget}
\end{figure}

\begin{lemma}
$G(m,n)$ minus the empty node has a color symmetric cycle if and only if
$T(m,n)$ has a cycle of cost $3(L(m,n)-1)/2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Each half of a color symmetric cycle in $G(m,n)$ corresponds
to a cycle in $T(m,n)$
in which each inter-gadget $2$-edge is followed by
the top $0$-edge, a vertical $1-$ edge, and finally the bottom $0$ edge.
The crossed pair of $1$-edges ensures proper completion of the cycle.
The total cost of this cycle is $2+0+1+0=3$ per gadget as claimed.
If we attribute to each gadget half the cost of all adjacent traversed
$2$-edges plus the cost of its traversed $1$-edges, then we see that
only the above traversal achieves a cost of $3$. Thus a cycle of cost
$3(L(m,n)-1)/2$ traverses each gadget exactly once, in an order
which yields a color symmetric cycle in $G(m,n)$.
\end{proof}

Using this lemma, we found the following 1x5 cycle:
\begin{verbatim} 
O....  O...O  .X..O  .XO.O  O.O.O  O.OOO  .X...  .X.O.  XX.O.
..OO.  O.OO.  .XOO.  .X..X  XX..X  ..O.X  O.O.X  .XO.X  .X.XX
XX.XX  ..O..  .XO..  O.O..  O.OX.  .X.X.  XX.X.  ..OX.  X.OX.
.OOX.  X..X.  X..XX  X.O..  X.O.X  .OO.X  OOO.X  ...XX  .O.XX
.OO..  OOO..  OOOO.  ....X  O...X  O..XX  OO.XX  ..XXX  O.XXX
OO...  OO..X  ..X.X  O.X.X  .XX.X  XXX.X  ...O.  X..O.  X.OO.
.OOO.  .OOOO
\end{verbatim} 
as well as 1x6 and 1x7 symmetric cycles which are too long to show here.

%\section{Number of Strings}
%Another basic concept in Go that is of combinatorial interest is
%the number of strings. While the number of stones in a legal $n \times n$
%%position has a trivial maximum of $n^2-2$, the maximum number of strings
%is not so easily determined.

\section{Open problems}
Computing $L(19,19)$, the number of
legal positions on a standard size Go board,
remains the main open problem.
The algorithm we present should suffice to compute it
within the next decade.
Still, a more space efficient algorithm would be welcome.

Theorem~\ref{asymptotic-formula} and its corollaries are contingent on
Conjecture~\ref{conjecture}. Proving this would be important but might
require a deep understanding of the structure of the border state
graphs and their spectral properties.

Game graphs are an interesting object of study for graph theorists.
We conjecture that all $G(1,n)$ with $n>2$ have color symmetric cycles.

Finally, a significant gap remains in the double exponent
between the upper and lower bound on the number of games.

\section{Acknowledgements}
We are indebted to Martin M\"{u}ller for suggesting publication of
these results,
to Piet Hut for extensive commentary on preliminary versions,
and especially to Michal Kouck\'{y} for the elegant idea of using
Chinese Remaindering and extensive help with developing and
running the file-based implementations that provided
the counts for $n=14 \ldots 17$.
